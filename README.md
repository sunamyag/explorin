Idea for codefundo++ ::
I am aiming to build such a technology which predicts the occurances of floods in flood prone areas. By taking data from the device that measures the level of water in the water bodies and also from a device which keeps track os the humidity in the air. By using the dataset of the level of water in the water body and the probability of flood occuring , that is , whether flood occured or not at that level, I can train the ML algorithm to predict flood based on that data. Also doing the same for the data from the second device. Also I will be first trying to improve the efficiency of the model.
After the predictions are known, and if the possbility is more than a specific percentage then, people need to be alerted about it. 
I plan to do this by making an app, which will signal people about the probable oncoming disaster.
